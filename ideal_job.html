      <p>I think this is my ideal job for numerous reasons. I am passionate about mental health awareness and increasing support for mental health services. Many of my family and friends have experienced periods of mental ill health during their lifetimes, including the time of great change and challenge surrounding the birth of a child.</p>
      <p>Many data analysis jobs are focused on improving revenue for business. I am not a money-focused person and would be more fulfilled knowing my skills are being used to improve the reach and efficiency of a not-for-profit mental health organisation. The hope would be that my IT skills would improve the experience of program users, expand the reach of the program so that more people can access it, and thereby improve the mental health of a vulnerable and often ignored section of the population.</p>
      <p>The role will involve collating volumes of data from various sources and creating powerful statistics and meaningful narratives from the data, in order to compellingly present to a variety of audiences on user experiences and the successes of the programs.</p>
      <p>The position requires enthusiastic and incisive data management and analysis skills, and a passion for discovering trends and insights from disorganised and eclectic data sets. The result is the transformation of complex data into comprehensible and persuasive presentations. Apart from IT skills in database management, SQL and Excel, and data dashboarding and reporting, the role requires project management skills to plan, execute and deliver the required outcomes.</p>
      <p>At this point I have very few of the skills required for this position. However I am a naturally confident oral presenter and do have a passion for data and insight. I love visual representations of data, and explaining data verbally alongside visual aids for maximum impact. I am poised in front of an audience and fielding questions, and am good at tailoring technical content to an appropriately accessible level to suit listeners.</p>
      <p>With training in the IT skills required for data analysis I could find an entry level data analysis role that worked on multiple data sets as part of a team. I plan to complete the Bachelor of IT through RMIT, and could supplement this with self-study or employment training in order to land this first job in data analytics. </p>
      <p>This first role would expose me to project management at an organisational level, working under experienced project managers, and closely observing their skills and performance. With continued experience I could take on more responsibility in the management of the project, and become a more vocal and pivotal team member in driving a project towards successful delivery. A more senior data analysis role, perhaps at a different organisation for breadth of experience, and involving supervision of junior analysts would further build on the skills required, especially if I volunteered to be responsible for meeting planning, project direction and stakeholder presentations. After some time in a role such as this I would be competent and confident to apply for my ideal job.</p>
